# Explanation
Text is normally colored a very light tan to contrast against blue colors, and to not be jarring against the light background color. StorageClass is a grey color to blend in well with the normal text color. Conversely, keywords and literals are colors that contrast against the normal text and each other. I am currently not sure whether I want comments to stand out or blend in to the background.

# Work In Progress
* summer-pastels (very w.i.p.)
* fall-pastels (minor changes)
* cleanup light/dark themes
* port to emacs
* ??? theme specific colors for things like TODO ???
